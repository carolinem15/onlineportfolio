# Responsive Portfolio Project

## Description

This application is a responsive portfolio that is meant to render well on different screen sizes. On this application, there are three linked pages: About, Portfolio, and Contact. Each page contains personal information about me as a student including social media, a short bio that includes my skills, and featured projects. In the future, I would like to build the portfolio page of this application to include more work as the coding bootcamp progresses. I would also like to add an option for users to contact me directly from this page. 

The purpose of this assignment is to maintain a good online portfolio and be as employer-competitive as possible. As I continue to update both my online portfolio and my professional online presence (including GitHub and Linkedin), I feel more and more confident going into the job search process.

## Installation

To access this application, simply click on the link provided. No other installs are necessary.

## Navigation

To navigate this application, there are three separate pages delineated in the navigation bar at the top of the page. When the application is viewed on a smaller screen size, the navigation bar shrinks into a drop down menu indicated by the little hamburger menu icon.
